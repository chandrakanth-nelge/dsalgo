	 * sequence of consecutive 1s.So the operation x = (x & (x << 1)) reduces length
	 * of every sequence of 1s by one in binary representation of x.If we keep doing
	 * this operation in a loop, we end up with x = 0. The number of iterations
	 * required to reach 0 is actually length of the longest consecutive sequence of
	 * 1's.
